# (This problem is an interactive problem.)
#
# A binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1. For each individual row
# of the matrix, this row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
#
# Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return leftmost column
# index(0-indexed) with at least a 1 in it. If such index doesn't exist, return
# -1.
#
# You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.  You may only access the matrix
# using a BinaryMatrix interface:
#
#     BinaryMatrix.get(x, y) returns the element of the matrix at index (x, y)
#     (0-indexed).
#     BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns a list of 2 elements [n, m], which
#     means the matrix is n * m.
#
# Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged
# Wrong Answer.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will
# result in disqualification.
#
# For custom testing purposes you're given the binary matrix mat as input in
# the following four examples. You will not have access the binary matrix
# directly.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]
# Output: 0
#
# Example 2:
# Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
# Output: 1
#
# Example 3:
# Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
# Output: -1
#
# Example 4:
# Input: mat = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1]]
# Output: 1
#
# Constraints:
#     1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 100
#     mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
#     mat[i] is sorted in a non-decreasing way.
